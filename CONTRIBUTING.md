## Getting started

Since all of you have Anaconda installed on your system, we need to check if git too is availble on your system. 
Open Anaconda Navigator, and launch Powershell

## ‚≠ê HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:

**1.** Start by making a Fork of the [**ProblemSolving**](https://github.com/vp09/ProblemSolving/) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/vp09/ProblemSolving/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a>Fork symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone your new fork of the repository in the terminal/CLI on your computer with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ProblemSolving
```

**3.** Navigate to the newly created LinkFree project directory:

```bash
cd ProblemSolving
```

**4.** Set upstream command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ProblemSolving.git
```

**5.** Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**6.** Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository:

- In your forked repository, click on "Fetch upstream"
- Click "Fetch and merge"

### Alternatively, Git CLI way to Sync forked repository with origin repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

### [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) for Syncing

**7.** Make your changes to the source code.

**8.** Stage your changes and commit:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to run the commands `git add .` or `git add *`. Instead, stage your changes for each file/folder

```bash
git add public
```

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**9.** Push your local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin YourBranchName
```

**10.** Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!

**11.** **Congratulations!** You've made your first contribution to [**ProblemSolving**](https://github.com/vp09/ProblemSolving/graphs/contributors)! üôåüèº

**_:trophy: After this, the maintainers will review the PR and will merge it if it helps move the all-round-calculator project forward. Otherwise, it will be given constructive feedback and suggestions for the changes needed to add the PR to the codebase._**

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/vp09/ProblemSolving/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/vp09/ProblemSolving/pulls) liberally after the first line.
